sunxyz.txt: interpolating functions that estimate the sun's xyz
position for 2011-2021, one function per year

sundiffplots.txt: plots of the difference between the sun's actual x,
y, and z positions, and the approximations

moonxyz: functions estimating lunar xyz 2011-2014 (Mathematica really
bogs down when doing this for 2015 up, hmmm)
