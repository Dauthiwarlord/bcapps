(* An attempt to find all quantities for a given unscaled triangle in
free space *)

(* Given any unscaled triangle in free space, you can resize it,
reflect it and place it on the complex plane such that two vertices
are 0 and 1, and the other point is z (where Re(z) and Im(z) are both
nonnegative. We therefore let z 'define' the triangle in question * )

(* Reference triangle: triangle-in-complex-plane.png *)

(* Sample triangle: 1/6 + 3/5*i, sort of like reference triangle *)
