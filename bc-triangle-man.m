(* An attempt to find all quantities for a given unscaled triangle in free space *)

(* Given any unscaled triangle in free space, you can resize it,
reflect it and place it on the complex plane such that two vertices
are 0 and 1, and the other point is x+yi, where x>=0 y>=0. We
therefore let x+yi 'define' the triangle in question * )
