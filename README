Instead of keeping all of my miniscule apps in a different github, I'll 
put them all here for now.

If any of them grows big enough, I'll create a new github for it.

Summary:

 bclib.pl: A library of useful functions

 bc-get-cycle-files.pl: obtain cycle files (weather) from NOAA sites

 bc-dns-server.pl: a simple Perl DNS server, template for more
 interesting DNS server

 bc-cheap-bay.pl: finds cheap available items on eBay (one penny, no
 shipping, no bids, expiring within 4 hours). You MUST have your own
 eBay API application key for this and you MUST put it in
 /usr/local/etc/ebay.id. Requires curl and tidy
