Attempts to create digraphs of some Choose Your Own Adventure books.

(yes, I know other people have done this too-- I'm hoping to turn it
into a multi-contributor project)

Inspired by http://www.ethblue.com/cyoa/</a> , this project seeks to
graph all CYOA books using the format below, and maybe make some nice
graphs using graphviz. Format example:

...
27/49+50
28/79
30/41+51
32
...

Line-by-line, the above (from "Third Planet From Altair") says:

"27/49+50" means: at the end of page 27, you make a choice which
takes you to either page 49 or page 50.

"28/79" means: at the end of page 28, you must continue to page
79. There is no choice to make.

"30/41+51" means exactly the same thing as "27/49+50" (from page 30,
you can choose to go to page 41 or 51).

"32" means that page 32 is an end point for the story. 

Notes:

"9/14+15+16" means: after page 9, you can go to page 14, 15, or 16.

Optional color coding format. Start the file like this:

# Third Planet From Altair
*:green:success
-:red:failure
v:gray50:cave
p:tan:3rd planet surface/orbit
s:white:on the ship
c:yellow:clouds/sky city
o:lightblue:ocean/dome city
x:pink:6th planet
m:orange:water moon

Lines starting with "#" (like the first line above) are comments.

Otherwise, the format is [single character]:[color]:[description]. Example:

"c:yellow:clouds/sky city" means pages with a "c" after them will be
colored yellow on the graph, and "clouds/sky city" means these pages
take place in the clouds or in Sky City.

"10c/17+19" means page 10 takes place in the clouds/Sky City.

"10/17c+19c" won't work. You can only color nodes occuring before the "/".

The first two non-comment lines of all files should be:

*:green:success
-:red:failure

Only assign these to story endpoints, where green means "successful"
ending and red means "unsuccessful" ending. TODO: make this less
subjective
