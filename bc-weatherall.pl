# Gave up on learning python (whitespace is significant? blech!), and
# porting bc-excuse-to-learn.py to Perl: this attempts to perform all
# weather functions that other programs have done individually: create
# Voronoi and Delauney maps for multiple data, download latest data,
# maintain db, etc. Once complete, this program will replace many others
