Highlights of my chat with them:

Godson Davis: We do not support SSH on our servers.
Godson Davis: We do not support command-line access.
Godson Davis: We do not support Cronjob.
Godson Davis: It is not possible to make system() calls from Perl/PHP scripts.

NOTE: Actually, you CAN make system() calls from Perl scripts.
