An attempt to geolocate IP addresses/hostnames, based on:

  - The hostname itself

  - The WHOIS or rr.arin.net records

  - DNS LOC

samplehosts*: some of these files were obtained by running various
mtr's on various hosts (including my attempt to hit one IP in every
"class C" network) [some runs are still in progress, so
samplehosts4.txt will change somewhat during early April 2012]

TODO: sometimes I can decode using IP, not hostname, so should store
all IPs, even those for which I already have hostnames
